TicTacTwo is a fully online version of Tic Tac Toe with a twist. A partially functional version is online at havvy.net:8080.

To play, you and your opponent must try to get three in a row, much like classic Tic Tac Toe. The twist comes after you make a few moves. I won't give it away, but I'll just say that it adds a bit of depth to the easily predetermined outcomes of the original.

TicTacTwo is run by running the node js server, but it also requires the express and socket.io frameworks. The server can be run by running node app.js in the TicTacTwo directory. App.js is the server code and controls the functionality of the code.
